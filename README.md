# Air Quality Classification using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
Air pollution is a critical environmental issue that impacts public health and overall quality of life. This project utilizes machine learning to classify air quality as Normal or Abnormal, helping in effective monitoring and decision-making. By analyzing key environmental factors, the model identifies pollution patterns and provides actionable insights.

The project follows a structured workflow, including Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand patterns, data preprocessing to clean and prepare the data, and model training using XGBoost, a powerful gradient boosting algorithm. The trained model is then evaluated to ensure high accuracy, and the results are visualized for better interpretation.

The goal is to develop an accurate classification model that can help monitor air pollution and support proactive environmental actions.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
 • Build a highly accurate air quality classification model.
 
 • Identify key environmental factors that influence air pollution levels.
 
 • Provide data-driven insights to support air quality monitoring and decision-making.
 
 • Enhance awareness of air pollution trends for better environmental management.
